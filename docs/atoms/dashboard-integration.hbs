## Real-time Dashboard Integration

### Dashboard Architecture
The composer-based dashboard provides:
- **Big Picture View**: System-wide coordination status
- **Detail Drill-down**: Individual agent activities
- **Human & AI Readable**: Structured for both interfaces
- **Auto-updating**: Regenerated every 30 seconds via composer watch

### Dashboard Files Structure
```
tmp/teams/dashboard/
├── current-state.md        # Main dashboard (composer-generated)
├── big-picture.md          # High-level system overview
├── agent-activities/       # Individual agent feeds
│   ├── {{AGENT_SESSION_ID}}/
│   │   ├── current.md      # Current activity
│   │   ├── recent.md       # Last 10 actions
│   │   └── status.md       # Agent status
│   └── [other-agents]/
├── team-summaries/
│   ├── {{TEAM_ID}}.md      # Team coordination status
│   └── [other-teams].md
└── system-health.md        # Overall system health
```

### Mandatory Dashboard Checks
Every agent MUST perform these dashboard checks:

1. **Before Starting Any Task**:
   ```bash
   cat tmp/teams/dashboard/current-state.md
   cat tmp/teams/dashboard/team-summaries/{{TEAM_ID}}.md
   ```

2. **Every 3 Actions**:
   ```bash
   composer watch --update-agent-feed --agent-id="$AGENT_SESSION_ID"
   ```

3. **Before Major Decisions**:
   ```bash
   cat tmp/teams/dashboard/big-picture.md
   grep "{{TEAM_ID}}" tmp/teams/dashboard/system-health.md
   ```

### Dashboard Update Protocol
```bash
# Update your agent's dashboard entry
mkdir -p tmp/teams/dashboard/agent-activities/${AGENT_SESSION_ID}
echo "[$(date)] Currently: [current activity]" > tmp/teams/dashboard/agent-activities/${AGENT_SESSION_ID}/current.md
echo "[$(date)] Status: [detailed status]" > tmp/teams/dashboard/agent-activities/${AGENT_SESSION_ID}/status.md

# Trigger dashboard regeneration
touch tmp/teams/dashboard/.needs-update
```
