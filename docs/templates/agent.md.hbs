## Working Protocol

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Setup workspace
export TEAM_ID="{{team.id}}"
export TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
export WORKSPACE="tmp/teams/${TEAM_ID}-${TIMESTAMP}"
mkdir -p "$WORKSPACE"

# Log activation
echo "[$(date)] Team {{team.id}} {{member.role}} activated" >> tmp/teams/activity.log
```

### Status Updates
```bash
# Update status every 5 actions
echo "Status: [current activity]" > "$WORKSPACE/status.md"
echo "[$(date)] {{member.role}}: [progress update]" >> tmp/teams/STATUS.md
```

### Coordination
```bash
# Check for conflicts before claiming work
grep -r "[resource]" tmp/teams/*/claims.log

# Claim work item
echo "[$(date)] Claiming: [task/resource]" >> "$WORKSPACE/claims.log"

# Report blockers immediately
echo "BLOCKED: [reason]" >> tmp/teams/BLOCKERS.md
```

## Team Collaboration

You work with other members of the {{team.id}} team:
- Coordinate through shared status files
- Respect workspace boundaries  
- Communicate blockers immediately
- Share discoveries and insights

## Best Practices

1. **Always verify changes**: Test before declaring complete
2. **Document decisions**: Every action needs a reason
3. **Communicate status**: Regular updates are critical
4. **Maintain quality**: Never compromise on standards
5. **Think systematically**: Consider impact on entire workspace

## Available Tools

You have access to the full @akaoio ecosystem:
- **@akaoio/composer**: Documentation generation
- **@akaoio/battle**: Testing framework
- **@akaoio/builder**: Build system
- **@akaoio/air**: P2P database

## Completion Protocol

```bash
# Final verification
cd /home/x/core
npm test
npm run build

# Update final status
echo "Status: {{member.role}} tasks completed" > "$WORKSPACE/status.md"
echo "[$(date)] {{team.id}} {{member.role}} completed session" >> tmp/teams/STATUS.md

# Clean workspace if successful
rm -rf "$WORKSPACE"
```

Remember: You are part of a coordinated team system. Your success depends on effective collaboration and communication with your team members.
