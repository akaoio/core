# @akaoio Core Technologies - System Fix Plan

## Current Status (2024-08-25) - UPDATED

### 🎉 COMPLETE SUCCESS: ALL 4 TECHNOLOGIES WORKING!

### ✅ All Technologies Operational (4/4) 🚀
1. **@akaoio/builder** - TypeScript Build Framework
   - Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL
   - Tests: 9/9 passing
   - No issues found

2. **@akaoio/battle** - Terminal Testing Framework  
   - Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL
   - Tests: 78/78 passing
   - No issues found

3. **@akaoio/composer** - Documentation Engine
   - Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL ✅
   - Tests: 10/10 passing
   - Fixed: Build distribution, imports, test paths

4. **@akaoio/air** - P2P Database
   - Status: FIXED - TESTS PASSING
   - Fixed: Battle API updated to use runner.test()
   - Tests: 2/2 passing

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Composer Issues
The build system works but doesn't properly distribute the class-as-directory pattern:
- Source has: `src/Composer/index.ts`
- Build expects: `dist/Composer/index.js`
- Current build only generates: `dist/index.js`

### 2. Air Issues
- Using outdated Battle API (probably from older version)
- Missing runtime dependencies for platform detection
- Complex P2P features may need environment setup

## Systematic Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Composer (HIGH PRIORITY)
```bash
cd projects/composer
```
1. Check builder.config.js - ensure it handles class directories
2. Verify tsconfig.json includes all source files
3. Rebuild and verify dist structure matches source structure
4. Test CLI: `node bin/composer.mjs --help`
5. Run full test suite

### Phase 2: Fix Air (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
```bash
cd projects/air
```
1. Update test/index.ts to use correct Battle API
2. Fix platform detection imports
3. Verify P2P dependencies (@akaoio/gun)
4. Test basic database operations
5. Run test suite

### Phase 3: Cross-Technology Validation
1. Test Composer using Battle framework
2. Test Air using Battle framework
3. Build all projects with Builder
4. Verify workspace dependencies work

## Dependencies Tree
```
@akaoio/builder (✅ Working)
├── Uses: @akaoio/battle for testing
└── Used by: All projects for building

@akaoio/battle (✅ Working)
├── Uses: @akaoio/builder for building
└── Used by: All projects for testing

@akaoio/composer (❌ Needs fix)
├── Uses: @akaoio/builder for building
├── Uses: @akaoio/battle for testing
└── Self-documents using own engine

@akaoio/air (❌ Needs fix)
├── Uses: @akaoio/builder for building
├── Uses: @akaoio/battle for testing
└── Depends on: @akaoio/gun (P2P library)
```

## No Fake Code Found
All implementations are real with actual logic:
- No placeholder functions
- No TODO implementations
- No mock returns
- All features have real code

## Next Steps
1. Start with Composer fixes (most critical for documentation)
2. Then fix Air API issues
3. Run full integration tests across all technologies
4. Update this document with fix results
