# Team Coordination

## Working with Other Teams
- Check for conflicts: `grep -r "{{PACKAGE}}" tmp/teams/*/claims.log`
- Avoid duplicate work: Read all team status files
- Share discoveries: Write to `tmp/teams/DISCOVERIES.md`

## Parallel Work Rules
- One package per team member
- Claim before starting
- Release on completion or blocking
