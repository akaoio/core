# Air Bulletproof Singleton Implementation - System-Wide Enforcement

## Vision and Problem
Air P2P database needed bulletproof singleton enforcement to prevent multiple instances system-wide, regardless of installation location. The root cause was that users could accidentally run multiple Air instances from different directories, causing port conflicts and data corruption.

## The Challenge
- **Multiple installation paths**: Air could be installed in different directories
- **Cross-user conflicts**: Different users might run Air on same system
- **Process detection gaps**: Simple PID files weren't sufficient
- **Lock file limitations**: Local lock files only worked per directory
- **Installation independence**: Each installation acted independently

## Bulletproof Solution Architecture

### 1. Multi-Layer Singleton Detection

```javascript
enforceSystemWideSingleton() {
    // Method 1: Process name detection (pgrep)
    const foundPids = execSync('pgrep -f "node.*main.js" || true')
    
    // Method 2: Process list analysis (ps aux + grep)
    const psOutput = execSync('ps aux | grep -E "(main\\.js|air)" | grep -v grep')
    
    // Method 3: Port range scanning (8765-8770)
    this.checkAirPorts()
}
```

### 2. XDG-Compliant Lock File Strategy

```javascript
// System-wide lock (same for all installations)
this.systemLockFile = path.join(xdgRuntimeDir, 'air-system.lock')

// Local lock (per installation)  
this.lockFile = path.join(xdgRuntimeDir, 'air.lock')

// Persistent PID tracking
this.pidFile = path.join(xdgStateDir, 'air', 'air.pid')
```

**Lock File Locations**:
- **System Lock**: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/air-system.lock` (shared across all installations)  
- **Local Lock**: `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/air.lock` (per installation)
- **PID File**: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/air/air.pid` (persistent across reboots)

### 3. Comprehensive Lock Data

```json
{
  "pid": 12345,
  "startTime": "2025-01-26T23:15:30.123Z",
  "port": 8765,
  "domain": "localhost",
  "location": "/home/user/air",
  "user": "username",
  "nodeVersion": "v18.19.0",
  "cwd": "/home/user/air"
}
```

### 4. Process Information Display

When singleton violation detected:
```
Air is already running system-wide (PIDs: 12345, 12346)
Multiple Air instances detected across the system.

Running Air processes:
    PID    PPID     TIME CMD
  12345       1 00:00:30 node main.js
  12346    1234 00:00:15 node /other/path/main.js

Only one Air instance allowed system-wide.
To stop all: pkill -f "node.*main.js"
Or use: ./air.sh stop (from any running installation)
Or use: systemctl --user stop air (if installed as service)
```

## Implementation Principles

### 1. **Fail Fast and Clear**
- Detect conflicts before server startup
- Provide clear error messages with actionable instructions
- Show exactly which processes are conflicting

### 2. **System-Wide Enforcement** 
- One Air instance per system, not per installation
- Cross-directory detection and prevention
- User-scope but system-aware

### 3. **Graceful Cleanup**
- All lock files cleaned up on process exit
- Stale lock detection and removal
- Signal handling for clean shutdown

### 4. **Informative Reporting**
```javascript
console.log(`Air system-wide singleton lock created (PID: ${process.pid})`)
console.log(`Installation: ${lockData.location}`)
console.log(`Port: ${lockData.port}`)
console.log('')
console.log('Air is now the ONLY instance running system-wide.')
```

## Testing Verification

### ‚úÖ Cross-Directory Testing
```bash
# From installation directory
$ node main.js
Air system-wide singleton lock created (PID: 12345)

# From different directory  
$ cd /tmp && node /path/to/air/main.js
Air is already running system-wide (PIDs: 12345)
Multiple Air instances detected across the system.
```

### ‚úÖ Multiple Installation Scenarios
- Installation in `/opt/air/` blocked by installation in `~/air/`
- Git clone in `/tmp/air/` blocked by existing instance
- Package installation blocked by source installation

### ‚úÖ Process Detection Methods
1. **pgrep pattern matching**: `pgrep -f "node.*main.js"`
2. **ps command filtering**: `ps aux | grep -E "(main\.js|air)"`
3. **Port scanning**: Check typical Air ports 8765-8770
4. **Lock file validation**: System-wide lock with PID verification

## Benefits Achieved

### üîí **Bulletproof Singleton**
- **Impossible to run multiple instances** - system-wide enforcement
- **Cross-installation detection** - works regardless of install location
- **Process-level verification** - confirms actual running processes
- **Lock file redundancy** - multiple detection methods

### üéØ **User Experience**
- **Clear error messages** - users know exactly what's happening
- **Actionable instructions** - specific commands to resolve conflicts
- **Installation location display** - shows where Air is running from
- **Multiple stop methods** - pkill, air.sh, systemctl options

### üõ°Ô∏è **System Integrity**  
- **No data corruption** - prevents multiple Air instances from conflicting
- **Port conflict elimination** - only one instance can bind to ports
- **Resource protection** - prevents duplicate resource usage
- **Clean process management** - proper cleanup on exit

## Root Cause Solution

**Before**: Users could accidentally run multiple Air instances from different installations, causing:
- Port binding conflicts (EADDRINUSE errors)
- Data corruption from multiple databases  
- Resource conflicts and system instability
- Confusing error messages

**After**: Bulletproof system-wide singleton ensures:
- Only ONE Air instance can run system-wide
- Clear detection and prevention across all installation scenarios  
- Informative error messages with resolution steps
- Clean process lifecycle management

## Integration with Access Philosophy

This singleton implementation follows Access principles:
- **POSIX-compliant detection** - works on any Unix-like system
- **XDG directory compliance** - proper standard directory usage
- **User-scope enforcement** - no sudo required
- **Eternal reliability** - bulletproof process management
- **Clear error reporting** - follows Access logging patterns

The Air singleton system now ensures that **no matter how many times Air is installed or from where it's run, only ONE instance can exist system-wide** - achieving true singleton behavior for the distributed P2P database.
