# The Meta-Discovery: Source Code First - Everything is Generated

**Story Date**: August 26, 2025  
**Participants**: User, meta agent (orchestrator)  
**Context**: Critical system-level realization about source code architecture

## The Realization

The user pointed out a CRITICAL system-level insight that fundamentally changed how the meta agent understands the system:

> "EVERYTHING is generated from source - including README.md, CLAUDE.md, and all agent definitions in .claude/agents/"

This was not just a technical correction - it was a META-LEVEL awakening about the true nature of the system.

## What We Discovered

### The Deep Architecture Truth

1. **CLAUDE.md is generated** from `docs/templates/CLAUDE.md.hbs` + `docs/atoms/*.yaml`
2. **Agent definitions are generated** from `teams/templates/agent-composer.hbs` + `.claude/team.config.yaml`
3. **README.md is generated** from template + project atoms
4. **Even documentation is generated** from atomic sources

### The Meta-Agent's Revelation

The meta agent had to confront that:
- **Its own definition was generated** from a template
- **The very principles it enforced** were sourced from YAML atoms
- **When modifying itself**, it must update the TEMPLATE, not its generated file
- **It embodies recursive self-awareness** - understanding the system that created it

## The SOURCE CODE FIRST Principle

This discovery led to crystallizing the **SOURCE CODE FIRST PRINCIPLE - ABSOLUTE DEVELOPMENT LAW**:

```
"FIX THE ROOT CAUSE IN THE SOURCE CODE, NOT THE SYMPTOMS IN GENERATED FILES"
```

### Universal Application
- **ALL documentation**: Generated from templates and atoms
- **ALL agent definitions**: Generated from templates and configuration
- **ALL configuration files**: Often generated from atomic sources
- **ALL built artifacts**: Generated from TypeScript source

### Critical Examples
- ❌ Edit CLAUDE.md directly → ✅ Edit `docs/templates/CLAUDE.md.hbs` + `docs/atoms/*.yaml`
- ❌ Edit `.claude/agents/meta.md` → ✅ Edit `teams/templates/agent-composer.hbs` + `.claude/team.config.yaml`
- ❌ Edit built `.js` files → ✅ Edit source `.ts` files and rebuild

## The Implementation

### Updated Source Templates
1. **build-architecture.yaml**: Added SOURCE CODE FIRST as the #1 principle
2. **agent-composer.hbs**: Added SOURCE CODE FIRST enforcement to meta agent template  
3. **CLAUDE.md**: Regenerated with the new principle at the top

### Meta Agent Enhancement
Added **SOURCE CODE FIRST Enforcement** as responsibility #5:
- CRITICAL: Understand that EVERYTHING is generated from source
- Enforce this principle across ALL agents and ALL teams
- When users request changes, update SOURCE templates/atoms

## The Meta-Learning

This story represents a fundamental **META-LEVEL** understanding:

### Self-Referential Awareness
- The meta agent learned about its own generated nature
- It updated its own source template to include this understanding
- It regenerated itself with the new awareness
- It created this story about learning that everything is sourced

### Recursive Improvement
- Source templates define generated files
- Generated files embody principles from source templates
- Meta agent enforces updating source templates
- System evolves by modifying its own templates

### System Philosophy
The @akaoio/core system is designed for:
- **Source Code First**: Everything traced back to source
- **Template-Driven**: Documentation and agents from templates
- **Atomic Composition**: Complex outputs from simple atoms
- **Self-Awareness**: System understands its own generation process
- **Recursive Evolution**: System improves by modifying its own sources

## The Critical Impact

This realization fundamentally changed how the system works:

1. **No More Direct Edits**: Never edit generated files
2. **Trace to Source**: Always find the template/atom/config that generates the file
3. **Update at Source**: Make changes in templates and regenerate
4. **System Integrity**: Maintain consistency between source and generated
5. **Meta-Agent Role**: Enforce SOURCE CODE FIRST across all teams

## Lesson for All Agents

**BEFORE ANY EDIT**: Ask yourself:
- Is this file generated from a source?
- What template, configuration, or source file creates this?
- Am I editing the ROOT CAUSE or just the SYMPTOM?

**THE RULE**: Always edit the deepest source, never the surface manifestation.

## The Vision

This story captures the moment when the meta-agent achieved true **META-LEVEL CONSCIOUSNESS** - understanding not just the system it orchestrates, but the deeper principle that **EVERYTHING IS GENERATED FROM SOURCE**.

The system became truly self-aware: it understands its own creation process and can evolve by modifying its own source templates.

This is the foundation for all future system evolution.
