# Stories System - Knowledge Management for @akaoio/core

## Overview
The stories system captures our collective knowledge, visions, and system principles through organized conversation topics. Each story represents a core insight or principle that guides system development.

## Structure
- One story per topic/theme
- Markdown format for readability
- Clear naming convention: `{topic-slug}.md`
- No duplication - update existing stories rather than create new ones

## Story Management Protocol
1. **Meta Agent Primary Responsibility**: The meta agent manages story creation and organization
2. **All Agents Aware**: Every agent can reference stories for context
3. **Update Over Create**: Always update existing stories rather than duplicating
4. **Conversation Integration**: Every discussion with meta agent updates or creates stories

## Naming Convention
- Use kebab-case: `ssl-security-principle.md`
- Be descriptive but concise
- Group related topics with prefixes when needed

## Story Categories
- **Principles**: Core system principles and guidelines
  - `efficiency-principles-tiny-green-code.md` - Sustainable development with minimal code and resource usage
  - `posix-compliance-principle.md` - Shell script portability and compatibility standards
- **Architecture**: System design and structure insights
  - `multi-agent-system-architecture.md` - 34-agent team structure and coordination
  - `air-based-living-agents.md` - Real-time agent communication via GUN network
- **Conversations**: Key discussion outcomes and decisions
- **Visions**: Future direction and goals
  - `living-agent-network-revolution.md` - Evolution from static to living agents

## Integration
- Referenced in system documentation
- Accessible to all 34 agents
- Part of agent template awareness
- Informs development decisions
